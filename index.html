        <p>My name is Josh, and I'm learning more of code because life is just more interesting this way.</p>
        <p>here are a few things about me.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I love computers</li>
            <li>I like the idea of creativity and that is why I want to create things using code, art, and writing</li>
            <li>I generally like watching anime, a few series, reading books and comics I really love</li>
        </ul>
